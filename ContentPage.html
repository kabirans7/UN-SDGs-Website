        <h1>The Quality of Education Around the World</h1>
        <h2 id="UK"><img src= "Images/UK.png" alt="UK">The United Kingdom</h2>
        
        <dl>
            <dt>Quality of education in the United Kingdom</dt>
            <dd>The United Kingdom possesses a valuable status in terms of
                its quality in education.
                This had been evidenced in <i>expatica for internationals</i> 
                report, where it stated
                that in the 2018 PISA tests, the UK performed above the
                OECD average for reading, Mathematics and Science.
                Additionally in primary and secondary schools, advanced
                teaching techniques are implemented by certified academic 
                professionals that aim to harness the youth into 
                educational prosperity. With demanding and strenuous examinations 
                such as GCSEs and A-Levels being undertaken by the youth, 
                it is undoubtable that the quality of education in the UK 
                is outstanding.
                Furthermore, universities in the UK such as Cambridge, Oxford, UCL 
                and many more, hold a huge global reputation, where people from 
                the UK as well as people worldwide compete to gain prospect in these educational
                institutions.
                Therefore, it is clear that the quality of education in the
                UK is exceptionally high.

                <dt>Quality of education in the United States of America</dt>
                <dd>
                    Like the United Kingdom, The United States of America holds
                    a valuable quality in education, where Ivy League universities such as
                    MIT, Harvard, Princeton and many more,
                    possess a grand global reputation, where people all across
                    the globe strive to study in these exceptional educational institutions
                    to further succeed in their career paths.
                    <i>Imed Bouchrika</i> in his 2024 article on US Public
                    Education Spending
                    stated that according to <i>the Report on the Condition of
                        Education in 2021,</i>
                        the total expenditure of the USA on elementary and
                        secondary education between 2017 and 2018,
                        amounted to $762 billion.
                        Hence, with an arena of successful and prospective
                        universities as well as high investment into education, it is evident
                        that the USA's quality of education is outstanding.

            <dd>
                According to <i>Unicef India's</i> reports, the quality of
                education in India is relatively poor due to many
                classrooms being continued in being subjected under
                teacher-centred rote learning,
                corporal punishment and discrimintation. Moreover, the
                <i>Education in India
                    Wikipedia page</i>stated that regardless of more than 95%
                    of children attending
                    primary school, only 40% of Indian adolescents attend 
                    secondary school.
                    <i>ClearIAS</i> concluded as of March 2024, that India's 
                    literacy rate is 74%, with Kerala topping the rankings, 
                    followed by Delhi,
                    Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. Bihar is the 
                    lowest amongst the
                    Indian states.
                    Despite these setbacks, India boasts some extremely
                    difficult exams such as the Joint Entrance Examination,
                    where it rigorously challenges engineering applicants in
                    their journey in being accepted into India's
                    best engineering universities such as the Indian Institutes
                    of Technology and the National Institutes of Technology.
                    Thus, with this mixed educational record, it can be 
                    judged that India's quality of education is somewhat moderate
                    but possesses exceptional features, particularly in higher education.

                    Gender equality in education, especially for women, in Afghanistan 
                    has been the centre of
                    discussion for quite a while.
                    After the Taliban's seizure of Afghanistan in 2021, Islamic  
                    education has been implemented as well as women face a
                    great deal of challenges
                    in order to gain equal access to education.
                    <i>The UN Human Rights Office Of The High Commissioner</i>
                    heavily highlighted in 2023
                    that quality education must be equally accessible to all.
                    The perpetual unlawful denial of girls and young women
                    from their right to education in Afghanistan showcases why
                    we need to do more.
                    In consequence of this factor, an entire gender and the
                    future generation of the world is greatly impacted.
                    If you join the cause for greater quality education,
                    you would be aiding the silent victims, who have been
                    denied their basic right of an education.
                    Volunteering and contributing to the cause is the only
                    thing required.
                    Globally and for the essence of humanity, our goal is to
                    improve the lives of everyone

                    The quality of education in Somalia can be characterised by
                    unpleasant circumstances.
                    <i>The Borgen Project</i> reports that there is a low
                    primary school enrollment rate, where only 30% of
                    children on average attend school, and only 18% attend in
                    secluded regions.
                    There is a vast gender disparity, where girls are provided
                    way less access to education than boys.
                    <i>The blog</i> continues to elaborate that Somalia
                    possesses high rates of female genital mutilation (FGM), with 98% of
                    Somali girls undergoing FGM at some point in their lives,
                    with 80% of them being between ages 5-9.
                    Due to the Somali civil war that consequently occurred in
                    1991, this has resulted in a lack of
                    educational resources and impacted the nation drastically.
                    It is clear that one country's quality of education would
                    be better than the other country.
                    This is due to unchangeable circumstances for the
                    unfortunate countries.
                    With your donation and involvement in our cause, you would
                    be ensuring
                    in greater quality education for young children worldwide.
