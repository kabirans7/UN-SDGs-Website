            <h3>User Profile</h3>
            <br>
            <span>I created a User Profile Page using HTML to 
            produce some information and CSS to style the page<br>
            I used JavaScript to code the prompts, buttons, progress bar
            and the general profile itself
            </span>

            <h3>Team</h3>
            <br>
            <span>I created the Team page with HTML and CSS<br>            
                I used images of the team members and added hover effects 
                to alter them<br>
                The hovered images show the names of each student, their
                role and the webpages they implemented
            </span>

            <h3>Content Page</h3>
            <br>
            <span>I created my Content page with HTML and CSS<br>
            I implemented a navigation bar with a list of countries
            mentioned in the page<br>
            I used anchor tags to refer to the countries on my
            navigation bar and my page editor below the webpage<br>
            I created description tags to form my content<br>
            I generated a <b>Go to top</b> button which is visible
            within the browser all the time and helps the user in navigation
            </span>

            <br>
            <span>My group and I together worked on the homepage<br>
                I aided with the nav bar hovering effects<br>
                I helped with the design of the page<br>
                I edited the footer and adapted the page</span>
